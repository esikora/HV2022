# Santa's Screenshot Render Function

## Starting Point
The challenge starts at a web page (`https://hackvent.deathspirate.com`) with a form in which the user can enter a URL:

![Welcome page](images/welcome.png)

No other resources are provided.

## Functionality of the Web Page

When the user enters a URL and submits the form, the web server apparently performs the following steps:

* Access this URL
* Render the web page internally
* Convert it to a bitmap image
* Store this image in a folder
* Send a web page with this image back to the user

We note that the functionality gives rise to an SSRF (serve-side request forgery) attack.

We can obtain some more information about the server by entering `https://www.whatismybrowser.com/` into the form with the following result:
