## Starting Point
For this challenge, a file `nice-list.zip` is provided along with the following description:

> Santa stored this years "Nice List" in an encrypted zip archive. His mind occupied with christmas madness made him forget the password. Luckily one of the elves wrote down the SHA-1 hash of the password Santa used.

> Can you help Santa access the list and make those kids happy?


## Initial Analysis of the Challenge and the ZIP File

The zip file contains two files one of which is `flag.txt`:

![zip content](images/zip_content.png)

flag.txt is encrypted with AES-256, and no compression is applied (`AES-256 Store`).

An SHA-1 hash value has a length of 160 bits, i.e. 20 bytes or 40 hex digits.
The given SHA-1 hash consists of 34 hex digits and an unknown prefix of 6 digits.

Apparently, the missing 6 digits need to be guessed. In the worst case, this would take $16^6 = 16.777.216$ attempts.
That seems generally feasible for some kind of brute force attack.
However, looking up this number of hashes in a rainbow table seems out of scope and might very well fail at all in case a strong password has been used.
Hence, there must be a different way to find out the password for decryption.

Some urgent questions come into mind that demand a closer investigation:

* How is the password used in zip AES-256 encryption, exactly?
* Is computing the SHA-1 hash of the password part of this procedure?


## Towards a Solution Concept

A good starting point for getting familiar with zip encryption using AES is https://www.winzip.com/en/support/aes-encryption/ and 
http://ccgi.gladman.plus.com/oldsite/cryptography_technology/fileencrypt/index.php.

A Python implementation of the decryption and verification process can be found here:
https://github.com/lclevy/unarcrypto/blob/master/unarcrypto.py#L92

According to the above documents, the AES-256 encryption key is generated from the password and a 16 bytes random salt using the PBKDF2 (password-based key derivation function 2) with HMAC-SHA1 as pseudo-random function.

```Python
keys = PBKDF2(password, salt, dkLen=66, count=1000)  # If prf is not specified, HMAC-SHA1 is used.
```

The result is a 66 bytes key array that is used as follows:
* 32 bytes (0..31): AES encryption key
* 32 bytes (32..63): authentication key
*  2 bytes (64..65): password verification value

To get an idea of how to solve the challenge, I found it helpful to look through the following articles:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)

Indeed, I found the essential hint in the PBKDF2 article in the section about HMAC collisions:

> If a supplied password is longer than the block size of the underlying HMAC hash function, the password is first pre-hashed into a digest, and that digest is instead used as the password.

Practically, this means that it might be possible to use the ASCII representation of the SHA-1 hash of the password instead of the password itself, as outlined, for instance, in:
https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/an-encrypted-zip-file-can-have-two-correct-passwords-heres-why/

Furthermore, the password verification value and authentication code in the zip file are quite useful for checking if we have guessed the right SHA-1 prefix.


## Solution Using John the Ripper

Based on the insights from the previous section, we can write e.g. a Python script to brute force the password, or we can use John the Ripper.
In both cases, the first step is to use `zip2john` to extract the relevant fragments of data from the encrypted zip file (see [zip2john.c](https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/src/zip2john.c)):

```bash
> zip2john nice-list.zip
```
The result is a file `nice-list.txt` with an entry for each encrypted file from the zip archive:

```
nice-list.zip/flag.txt:$zip2$*0*3*0*e07f14de6a21906d6353fd5f65bcb339*5664*41*e6f2437b18cd6bf346bab9beaa3051feba189a66c8d12b33e6d643c52d7362c9bb674d8626c119cb73146299db399b2f64e3edcfdaab8bc290fcfb9bcaccef695d*40663473539204e3cefd*$/zip2$:flag.txt:nice-list.zip:nice-list.zip
nice-list.zip/nice-list-2022.txt:$zip2$*0*3*0*a53ba8a665f2c94e798835ab626994dd*96cc*5b*72b0a11e9ef17568256695cf580c54400f41cfe0055f1b0800ff91374216313ff9b6dc2c9b1309f9765e3873122d8e422e2d9ecd2c7aa6cbf66105ce837a0fe46c18dc6ccc0cb25f59233c9223d699f43bc2e69c5117b307f813fc*6308b50240b2b882b61e*$/zip2$:nice-list-2022.txt:nice-list.zip:nice-list.zip
```

These entries have the following structure:

```
filename:$zip2$*Ty*Mo*Ma*Sa*Va*Le*DF*Au*$/zip2$
 * Ty = type (0) and ignored.
 * Mo = mode (1 2 3 for 128/192/256 bit)
 * Ma = magic (file magic). This is reservered for now. See pkzip_fmt_plug.c or zip2john.c for information. For now, this must be a '0'
 * Sa = salt(hex). 8, 12 or 16 bytes of salt (depends on mode)
 * Va = Verification bytes(hex) (2 byte quick checker)
 * Le = real compr len (hex) length of compressed/encrypted data (field DF)
 * DF = compressed data DF can be Le*2 hex bytes, and if so, then it is the ENTIRE file blob written 'inline'.
 * Au = Authentication code (hex) a 10 byte hex value that is the hmac-sha1 of data over DF. This is the binary() value
```

John the Ripper finds the decryption password within a few seconds:

```bash
> john --mask='?a?a?aiy+g~>LzmxT\\ \\N^&' nice-list.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 2 password hashes with 2 different salts (ZIP, WinZip [PBKDF2-SHA1 256/256 AVX2 8x])
Loaded hashes with cost 1 (HMAC size) varying from 65 to 91
Will run 2 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
4Ltiy+g~>LzmxT\ \N^& (nice-list.zip/nice-list-2022.txt)     
4Ltiy+g~>LzmxT\ \N^& (nice-list.zip/flag.txt)     
2g 0:00:00:04 DONE (2022-12-20 20:06) 0.4514g/s 24039p/s 48079c/s 48079C/s ]wtiy+g~>LzmxT\ \N^&..aQtiy+g~>LzmxT\ \N^&
Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

The parameter `--mask='?a?a?aiy+g~>LzmxT\\ \\N^&'` is built as follows:
* `--mask='...'` selects mask mode as described in https://miloserdov.org/?p=5031#32
* The string `iy+g~>LzmxT\ \N^&` is the ASCII representation of the partial SHA-1 hash `69792b677e3e4c7a6d78545c205c4e5e26`
* Each `\` in the string is escaped as `\\`
* `?a` is the placeholder for all printable ASCII characters (3 ascii characters to represent 6 unknown hex digits)

The result is that the approch works and the missing characters of the password are `4Lt`.


## Decryption and Decompression using 7z

On Linux, 7z can extract AES-256 encrypted ZIP files. I copied the ASCII password into the clipboard in order to paste it when 7z asks for it:

```bash
> 7z x nice-list.zip
